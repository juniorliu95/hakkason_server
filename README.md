## Aim
We aimed to build a app for taking pictures and send the picture to a server for 3D-processing, and then feedback the image to the user. The connection is made by socket client between the phone and the model on the computer.
This is the server part of the project.

## This work is based on code and paper of: 
This is a simple project for [技育CAMP]vol1 チームフーバー. We implemented the model from https://github.com/sniklaus/3d-ken-burns and aimed to realize it using Android phone.
