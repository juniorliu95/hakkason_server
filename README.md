## Aim
We aimed to build a app for taking pictures and send the picture to a server for 3D-processing, and then feedback the image to the user.

## This work is based on code and paper of: 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05483" rel="Paper"><img src="http://content.sniklaus.com/kenburns/paper.jpg" alt="Paper" width="100%"></a>

## setup
The same as the original code in:
https://github.com/sniklaus/3d-ken-burns

We added the socket module to communicate with the client part.
